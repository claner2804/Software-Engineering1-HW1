"8. Create a method that asks for displaying the information about a certain
number nrObjsToDisplay of students stored in the array created in item 7.
Ensure that nrObjsToDisplay is a valid value and deal with the situation
where nrObjsToDisplay is out of bound (i.e. it is either bigger than nrStud or
negative) by defining your own exception class.
You will need to throw and catch your exception objects when nrObjsToDisplay
is out of bound"


This Exercise 8 is added to the class StudentManager in exercise 7.
